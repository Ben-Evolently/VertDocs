This process is extremely resource intensive on a computer, and so the community works together in a peer-to-peer mining pool to validate these transactions. Additionally, the computers that do this hashing work for the network are eligible to claim brand new vertcoins as a reward when a new block is found on the network.\n\n\nWhy do we need miners?\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn other currencies, a central bank keeps record of online transactions in order to decide who owns that money. However, as a decentralized currency, Vertcoin does not have a central organization to keep record of these transactions. Mining is the act that validates these transactions, and without miners, Vertcoins would not be able to traded.\n\n\nWhat hardware do I need?\n\u00b6\n\n\nIf you are interested in mining for Vertcoin to purpose the community, nearly any computer is strong enough and can join the network. If you are instead searching for profitable mining, a higher-end GPU is recommended, like a Pascal series or similar NVidia GPU. Currently, AMD cards struggle with stable high-speed hashing of the Lyra2REv2 algorithm, but can still contribute at lower speeds. CPU mining is too slow to be profitable. Large arrays of consumer-grade GPUs can also be used across multiple machines to achieve higher hashrates pooled into a single p2pool node and wallet. Note that ASIC miners will not work for Vertcoin, as is the intention of the currency.  \n\n\nPrerequisite Information\n\u00b6\n\n\nVertcoin uses the Lyra2REv2 hashing algorithm for mining in order to maintain its ASIC-resistance. This opens the door to consumer-grade electronics as the primary mining force of the currency. Vertcoin uses p2pool mining pools, and runs two networks. The first network is recommend for miners generating over 100MH/s, and the second network for those under that line. Vertcoin also has its own One Click Miner to reduce the technical barrier of entry for those interested in mining.\n\n\nWhat software do I need?\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn order to mine Vertcoin you will need a \nVertcoin Core Wallet\n. You will also need a mining program of your choice that supports the Lyra2REv2 hashing algorithm. If you do not plan on hosting a local p2pool node, this is all you need. If you do plan on hosting a p2pool node, you can find out more about the installation from the \nGitHub page\n.  \n\n\nWhat program should I use?\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhile that is mostly up to preference, there are three primary programs that are used for mining. The recommended program for users new to mining and with NVidia GPUs is the official One Click Miner (OCM) developed by the Vertcoin team. The OCM is a wrapper for vertminer, and should yield similar results in hashrate. The OCM is still under development for users with AMD cards in order to optimize the hashing rates. One miner that can achieve higher hashrates is \nsgminer-gm\n, however it can also be more unstable and even lead to OS crashes in rare cases.",

Welcome to the VertDocs \nNvidia Mining Guide\n. In cryptocurrency, mining means to provide computation power to solve certain mathematical equations which in return helps keep the entire network (also known as the blockchain) secure. Miners are incentivized by the block rewards provided when a block is found for the network.\n\n\nLet's get started!\n\n\nBasic Requirements for mining VTC with Nvidia Cards:\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nDecent Equipment\n - A computer with (\nrecommended\n) Nvidia 10 series or (\nminimum\n) Nvidia 9 series GPU. \n\n\nUnderstand your electricity tariff\n - Assuming an electricity tariff of $0.1/kWh, if you have \nDecent Equipment\n as stated above, you'll most likely mine with a decent profit. However, if your electricity tariff rate is low you may be able to mine profitably even with an older card.\n\n\nStable internet connection\n - Doesn't need to be blazing fast, just normal cable/fibre will do but it has to be stable for optimum results.\n\n\nPatience\n - Setting up your mining tools etc. can be really quick, or it can be really troublesome for some people. As long as you have the heart to follow through, no reason you can't be mining with decent equipment! :)\n\n\nMore patience\n - Ideally, set things up and let it run for 24 hours or more before you decide if its worth it at all. This is especially true if you are mining on p2pools (LINK TO GUIDE). Regular pools will pay you almost every hour, but that does not mean that it is better. You can try around to see what works best for you.\n\n\nFinish this guide!\n - No really. Try and finish this guide. I promise it'll be worth it! \n\n\n\n\nThat said, lets get going!\n\n\nVertcoin (VTC) is based on the Lyra2REv2 algorithm which is mineable by most modern Nvidia GPUS (10 series) profitably. However, this does not mean that older generation cards aren't able to mine at all - they can, but not as profitable as 10 series cards. As long as your card isn't overly dated (older than 9 series) you should still be able to make a smaller profit or breakeven. As a benchmark to get you started, you can estimate your card's profitability using \nCoinWarz's online calculator\n. \n\n\nAssuming you have a Standard Desktop with 1 GPU, calculate your power as 100W (for all other components in PC) + GPU draw) and leave the other fields as default. As a guide a table below shows the rough hashrate of several Nvidia 10 series GPUs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Model\n\n\nHashrate (Mh/s)\n\n\nPower Consumption (W)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGTX 1050ti\n\n\n~15 Mh/s\n\n\n70 watts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGTX 1060 3gb\n\n\n~ 22 Mh/s\n\n\n100 - 120 watts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGTX 1060 6gb\n\n\n~ 27 Mh/s\n\n\n100 - 120 watts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGTX 1070\n\n\n~ 35 - 40 Mh/s\n\n\n150 watts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGTX 1070ti\n\n\n~ 40 - 45 Mh/s\n\n\n180 - 250 watts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGTX 1080\n\n\n~ 45 - 50 Mh/s\n\n\n250 watts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the values above are only estimates, and can be a lot better with proper \noptimization\n. For example, an optimized GTX 1070 (limit to 65% power, core overclock +130) can achieve 34 Mh/s while only drawing ~100 watts. As miner software and better graphic drivers gets released overtime, it is likely that you will see more (slight) increases in your card's mining efficiency.\n\n\nGetting Started\n\u00b6\n\n\nVertcoin mining is simple and easy to get into. To get started with Nvidia mining, you will require the following:\n* (a) \nVertcoin Core Wallet\n (Note: Do NOT mine to electrum wallet \u2013 \nhere\u2019s why\n)\n* (b) \nVertcoin\u2019s One Click Miner\n\n* \u00a9 Address of the mining pool you wish to mine on (eg. stratum+tcp://vertpoolname:1234)\n* (d) To monitor/optimize \u2013 MSI Afterburner\n\n\nSteps:\n\u00b6\n\n\nInstalling and setting programs up\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nDownload and unzip \n(a) Core Wallet\n. Vertcoin-qt.exe will be the one you use most of the time as it is the one with the Graphical User Interface. During first start up you will be prompted to select your Blockchain Data location \u2013 put it on a storage with plenty of space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen up \n(a) Core Wallet\n and let it sync \u2013 the rate at which the sync occurs should increase as you get more connections to other Core Wallet users (it is p2p, which means other users share their data for you to download). You can increase the speed at which it syncs by downloading the \nBootstrap file\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall \n(b) Vertcoin One Click Miner\n (OCM). When you run it for the first time it will prompt you to select your Vertcoin Blockchain Data (in this example it is D:\\VTC Blockchain Data as indicated in the picture above)\n\n\n\n\nGetting your Miner\u2019s Address (You will receive payment with this)\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nWhile the Core Wallet syncs, Click \nHide\n to hide the sync progress window and reveal the User Interface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to \nReceive\n and enter \nLabel\n as appropriate (eg. Mining from Pool XYZ) > Click \nRequest Payment\n and an address will be generated for you. Double click on your generated address to reveal more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may now minimize the Vertcoin Core Wallet to let it continue syncing \u2013 the generated receiving address will be used later.\n\n\n\n\nSetting up One Click Miner to mine on regular mining Pools (For P2Pools please move to the next section.)\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nOpen up the OCM (Vertcoin One Click Miner.exe) you have just installed.\n\n\nNavigate to \nAdd Pool\n and enter the following (refer to image below):\n\n\nYour Miner Address generated in Step (5) into Miners Address Field. Beware of any ninja \u201cspace\u201d behind the address when pasting!\n\n\nYour \u00a9 Pool Address into the Pool Address Field.\n\n\nLeave password as x. It does not affect your mining.\n\n\n(Optional) Add description as necessary to help remember pool details\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the left side of the interface, select Nvidia (ccminer OR Vertminer) and click \n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \nStart\n. OCM will prompt you to install whichever miner you have selected. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Note: Vertminer is a repackaged ccminer which includes 2% donation (you donate 2% of your hash time), but users typically report 2 to 8% increase in hashrate as it is optimized for VTC\u2019s algorithm, so it may be well worth it. Feel free to experiment between both miners.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \nsettings\n on top, tick \nShow CLI\n \u2013 this will help you determine if you are mining correctly by showing the command line window. Once you have gotten the hang of it and you know your miner runs fine, you may untick it as it will not affect your mining in any way. \n\n\nIf you would like to add more pool to the list, feel free to do so. Those pools will act as failovers \u2013 the miner switches over to those if the pool you are currently mining on goes down. OCM will pick the first pool in the list to begin mining. Move to the next step if you do not want to add more pools.\n\n\nOnce you have completed all the steps above, you may click \nStart\n to begin mining. You should see something similar to below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you see something similar to the above, congratulations! You are now mining!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinue to mine until you get your first payment. Once you get it, you can be sure that you are mining Vertcoin!\n\n\n\n\nSetting up One Click Miner to mine on P2Pools\n\u00b6\n\n\nIf you are wondering where there is a need to mine on p2pool, read (Link to p2pool document). In essence P2Pool helps with decentralization and distribution of hashrate. For some, p2pool mining is also slightly more profitable since they can mine locally which eliminates issues arising due to latency and/or dependencies on other mining pools' uptime.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen up OCM, go to settings. For p2pool hosting there are a few settings that you should take note of:\n\n\n\n\nNetwork\n - Select the appropriate network based on your mining hashrate. Network 1 is made for miners with >100 Mh/s while Network 2 is made for miners with <100 Mh/s. \nAlternatively\n, you can check out the \nP2Proxy Pool\n.\n\n\nFee\n - This represents the fee you collect from miners who mine on your p2pool.\n\n\nFee\n \nAddress\n - Fees you collect will be in this address.\n\n\nDonation\n - % of Mining proceeds on your p2pool will go to the VTC developers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn OCM, tick \nRun Local Node\n. A CLI should open up as below: \n\n\n\n\nIt should then load up to something similar to below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you get the above up and running, click on \nAdd Pool\n and add the following in Pool Address field:\n\n\n\n\nNetwork 1: stratum+tcp://localhost:9171\n\n\nNetwork 2: stratum+tcp://localhost:9181\n\n\n\n\nWorker address is taken from the one you generated in Step (5). Password can be x.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter this is done, select the pool you just added and start mining away! You can verify that you are mining by checking the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn OCM, the \nMiner Hashrate\n isn't 0 kh/s\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a few minutes, open up your browser, go to (Network 1) \nhttp://localhost:9171/static/\n or (Network 2) \nhttp://localhost:9181/static/\n. Your miner should be on the list and has a non-zero share difficulty associated with it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, if you mine on other people's pool, you should see something similar to below when you are mining correctly. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u200b                    \nIf yours look similar to the above, you are good to go!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Mining on P2Pool involves a bit of luck and you may need to wait up to 24h before getting your first payout. \n\n\nOptimizing:\n\u00b6\n\n\nIf you are able to run everything, you may try to optimize your mining rate by limiting certain parameters on your card \u2013 do this on your own risk! The optimizing mentioned here are just suggestions \u2013 please feel free to tweak as necessary.\n\n\n\n\nMSI Afterburner\n\n\nOption 1: 65% Power, +100 Core Clock, -400 Memory Clock\n\n\nOption 2: 90% Power, +100 Core Clock, -400 Memory Clock\n\n\n\n\nChange your fan settings! Generally it is recommended to keep your card temperature below 70\u00b0C so adjust the fan curve as necessary. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntensity Settings in OCM\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is generally recommended to leave intensity as default \u201c0\u201d (max) so that the software can automatically optimize the miner to provide the best results. However, your mileage may vary and it is still recommended that you try it out to see the results for yourself.\n\n\n\n\nHardware: Casing airflow\n\n\n\n\nIf you haven\u2019t done so, it may be a good time now to investigate your casing\u2019s airflow (check your fans, clean out the dust filter, make sure there is some form of air circulation etc.). A cool GPU is a happy GPU, and a happy GPU gives the best results :) Once again, it is recommended to keep temperatures below 70\u00b0C.\n\n\nQuick TL;DR Checklist:\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nInstalled (a) Vertcoin Core Wallet and (b) One Click Miner.\n\n\nAdded both items to Exclusion list of Anti-virus and Firewall\n\n\nGenerated a Receiving address with Core Wallet\n\n\nInstalled Nvidia Miner on One Click Miner\n\n\nMiner hashrate on OCM is not 0 when start is clicked\n\n\nIf mining on P2Pool, miner is on list and hashrate is shown along with non-zero share difficulty.\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting:\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nIf you haven't yet, try restarting your PC after installing everything!\n\n\nStratum Connection failed!\n\n\nCheck your Firewall/Antivirus settings. Miner programs occasionally get blocked or flagged as malicious.\n\n\nTry a different pool instead, the pool could be down at the moment.\n\n\nNo Hashrate shown in OCM despite successful connection in CLI\n\n\nCheck your Graphic Drivers and ensure they are up to date\n\n\nWhy don\u2019t I see my payouts in the Core Wallet even after the pool says that it has paid?\n\n\nYour core wallet may not be fully synced (not up to date with the latest blockchain data). Give it some more time and it should show up as soon as it syncs up to the point where you are paid.\n\n\nOn the P2Pool web interface (\nhttp://localhost:91x1/static/\n) why does my miner have 0 share difficulty?\n\n\nYou may have accidentally included a \"ninja\" space behind your Miner Address when pasting it during the Add Pool step!\n\n\nI have been mining on the p2pool for 24 hours, and still did not get any payouts at all!\n\n\nThis is where you need to give your miner some more time - mining on p2pool involves some luck and when you are lucky, you find more shares than usual (more payouts, yay!) and when you get unlucky, you don't find shares for a period of time (boo! :( I know) but if you have mined for long enough, it should even out based on your estimations.\n\n\nAlternatively, try mining on \nP2Proxy Pool\n if you are really struggling to find shares.\n\n\n\n\nThat is all for the Vertcoin Nvidia mining guide!

Understand your electricity tariff  - Assuming an electricity tariff of $0.1/kWh, if you have  Decent Equipment  as stated above, you'll most likely mine with a decent profit. However, if your electricity tariff rate is low you may be able to mine profitably even with an older card.  Stable internet connection  - Doesn't need to be blazing fast, just normal cable/fibre will do but it has to be stable for optimum results.  Patience  - Setting up your mining tools etc. can be really quick, or it can be really troublesome for some people. As long as you have the heart to follow through, no reason you can't be mining with decent equipment! :)  More patience  - Ideally, set things up and let it run for 24 hours or more before you decide if its worth it at all. This is especially true if you are mining on p2pools (LINK TO GUIDE). Regular pools will pay you almost every hour, but that does not mean that it is better. You can try around to see what works best for you.  Finish this guide!  - No really. Try and finish this guide. I promise it'll be worth it!    That said, lets get going!  Vertcoin (VTC) is based on the Lyra2REv2 algorithm which is mineable by most modern Nvidia GPUS (10 series) profitably. However, this does not mean that older generation cards aren't able to mine at all - they can, but not as profitable as 10 series cards. As long as your card isn't overly dated (older than 9 series) you should still be able to make a smaller profit or breakeven. As a benchmark to get you started, you can estimate your card's profitability using  CoinWarz's online calculator .   Assuming you have a Standard Desktop with 1 GPU, calculate your power as 100W (for all other components in PC) + GPU draw) and leave the other fields as default. As a guide a table below shows the rough hashrate of several Nvidia 10 series GPUs:     GPU Model  Hashrate (Mh/s)  Power Consumption (W)      GTX 1050ti  ~15 Mh/s  70 watts    GTX 1060 3gb  ~ 22 Mh/s  100 - 120 watts    GTX 1060 6gb  ~ 27 Mh/s  100 - 120 watts    GTX 1070  ~ 35 - 40 Mh/s  150 watts    GTX 1070ti  ~ 40 - 45 Mh/s  180 - 250 watts    GTX 1080  ~ 45 - 50 Mh/s  250 watts     Note that the values above are only estimates, and can be a lot better with proper  optimization . For example, an optimized GTX 1070 (limit to 65% power, core overclock +130) can achieve 34 Mh/s while only drawing ~100 watts. As miner software and better graphic drivers gets released overtime, it is likely that you will see more (slight) increases in your card's mining efficiency.",

Parts List\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParts\n\n\nPrice\n\n\nLink\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCanaKit Raspberry Pi 3 B+\n\n\n$49.99 USD\n\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-Power-Supply-Listed/dp/B07BC6WH7V/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSamsung 32GB 95MB/s (U1) MicroSD EVO Select Memory Card\n\n\n$12.99 USD\n\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Samsung-MicroSD-Adapter-MB-ME32GA-AM/dp/B06XWN9Q99/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSanDisk Ultra Fit 128GB USB 3.0 Flash Drive\n\n\n$27.49 USD\n\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Ultra-128GB-Flash-Drive/dp/B01BGTG2A0/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranscend USB 3.0 SDHC / SDXC / microSDHC / SDXC Card Reader\n\n\n$9.23 USD\n\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Transcend-microSDHC-Reader-TS-RDF5K-Black/dp/B009D79VH4/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*OPTIONAL: Zebra Black Ice Case for Raspberry Pi by C4Labs\n\n\n$14.95 USD\n\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Zebra-Black-Case-Raspberry-C4labs/dp/B00M6G9YBM/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may change the USB Flash Drive to match your preference. I \nhighly recommend\n that a USB Flash Drive (16GB - 128GB) or an External Hard Drive is paired with the Raspberry Pi. \n\n\nThe case in the parts list is a personal preference, it is your choice how you wish to protect your Raspberry Pi. The Zebra Black Ice case was chosen for it's cut out on the bottom of the case, allowing for the placement of a heatsink on the \nRAM\n of the Raspberry Pi. \n\n\n2.) Download and sync Vertcoin Core\n\u00b6\n\n\nThis step is \noptional\n but recommended. \nDownload\n the latest stable release of Vertcoin Core and launch \nvertcoin-qt.exe\n to begin the syncing process. I use my desktop PC to sync the blockchain first because it has better specs than a $35 Raspberry Pi. The PC will sync headers, download blocks and verify blocks faster than the Raspberry Pi can.\n\n\nWe will use this copy of the blockchain that is syncing to side-load onto our Raspberry Pi later.\n\n\nIf you choose not to follow this step, create a new folder named \nvertcoin\n on your USB Flash Drive that you will format in the next step.\n\u00b6\n\n\nVertcoin Core Download Link: https://github.com/vertcoin-project/vertcoin-core/releases\n\n\nDefault Windows Directory (Vertcoin): C:\\Users\\%USER%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Vertcoin\n  \n\n\n3.) Format USB Flash Drive\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nThe Vertcoin blockchain is about 4GB today (4/23/2018) which means that a 16GB USB Flash Drive will have more than enough space to store everything we need, but you can easily future proof with a 128GB USB Flash Drive.  \n\n\n\n\nInsert the USB Flash Drive into your Windows PC. Then access the drive with Windows Explorer \nWin+E\n, right click on the removable drive you wish to format and \nFormat...\n\n\nFormat the USB Flash Drive to an \nNTFS\n File system. \n\n\nThis USB Flash Drive will contain our Vertcoin data directory as well as our swap space file. We will give the Raspberry Pi some extra memory to work with we will ensure a swap file large enough to handle the memory demand to bootstrap the blockchain. \n\n\nIt is worth mentioning that constantly writing data to the MicroSD card can be damaging, in this guide we will configure the swap file to reside off of the card.\n\n\n4.) Install Raspbian Stretch Lite\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nRaspbian is a free operating system based on Debian, optimised for the Raspberry Pi hardware. Raspbian comes with over 35,000 packages: precompiled software bundled in a nice format for easy installation on your Raspberry Pi.\n\n\nhttps://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/raspbian/\n\n\n\n\nI recommend downloading the latest stable version of \nRaspbian Stretch Lite\n. \n\n\nWe will utilize the software 'Win32 Disk Imager' to format and install Raspbian on the MicroSD card. Please follow the \nguide\n below for details on installing the Rasbian image to the MicroSD card.\n\n\nRaspberry Pi - Installing Operating System Images Using Windows: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/windows.md\n\n\nOnce Win32 Disk Imager is finished writing to the MicroSD card please access the 'boot' partition of the MicroSD card with Windows Explorer \nWin+E\n. Create a new empty text file named \nssh\n like so...\n\n\n\nThis enables SSH access on the Raspberry Pi's first boot sequence. Please safely remove the USB Card Reader / MicroSD card as to ensure the data is not corrupted.\n\n\nRaspian Download Link: https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/\n  \n\n\nWin32 Disk Imager Documentation: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/windows.md\n\n\n5.) Copy Blockchain to USB Flash Drive\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhen \nVertcoin Core\n is finished syncing the blockchain please navigate to the data directory for \nVertcoin\n\n\nDefault Windows Directory (Vertcoin): C:\\Users\\%USER%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Vertcoin\n  \n\n\nCreate a new folder named \nvertcoin\n on your USB Flash Drive that was formatted as an \nNTFS\n file system earlier and copy the folders \nblocks\n and \nchainstate\n to the \nvertcoin\n folder on your USB Flash Drive. This will allow us to side-load the Vertcoin blockchain and bootstrap faster than if we had the Raspberry Pi do all the work. \n\n\n6.) Setup Raspberry Pi\n\u00b6\n\n\nPlease insert the MicroSD card that was safely removed into the slot located on the bottom of the Raspberry Pi. Connect an Ethernet cable to the Raspberry Pi that has internet access. When you are ready to power on the Pi, plug the power supply in and the Raspberry Pi will immediately begin to boot.\n\n\nWe will access our Raspberry Pi through an SSH session on our Windows PC. I like to use \nGit Bash\n which is included in the Windows \ndownload\n of \nGit\n.\n\n\nGit download link: https://git-scm.com/downloads\n  \n\n\nOpen a web browser page and navigate to your router page and identify the \nIP\n address of the freshly powered on Raspberry Pi. In my case the \nIP\n address is \n192.168.1.2\n, please make note of your Raspberry Pi's \nIP\n address as we will need to use it to login via \nSSH\n.  \n\n\n# Open \nGit Bash\n and ...\n\n\n~ $ ssh 192.168.1.2 -l pi\n\n\ndefault password: raspberry\n\n\n# Download and install latest system updates\n\n\npi\n@\nraspberrypi\n:~\n \n$\n \nsudo\n \napt-get\n \nupdate\n \n;\n \nsudo\n \napt-get\n \nupgrade\n \n-y\n\n\n# Remove orphaned packages and clean \napt\n\n\npi\n@\nraspberrypi\n:~\n \n$\n \nsudo\n \napt-get\n \nautoremove\n \n;\n \nsudo\n \napt-get\n \nautoclean\n\n\n# Initiate \nraspi-config\n script\n\n\npi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo raspi-config\n\n\n1.)

I \nDO NOT RECOMMEND\n anyone who is serious about mining \nVertcoin\n to mine on a \np2pool\n setup on the Raspberry Pi \nVertcoin\n full node. I have experienced connectivity issues between \np2pool\n and the \nvertcoin daemon\n losing connection to the full node for minutes at a time creating numerous \nstratum\n timeouts. This section exists only for those wishing to experiment. \n\n\n\n\nP2Pool is a decentralized Bitcoin mining pool that works by creating a peer-to-peer network of miner nodes.\n\n\nP2Pool creates a new block chain in which the difficulty is adjusted so a new block is found every 30 seconds. The blocks that get into the P2Pool block chain (called the \"share chain\") are the same blocks that would get into the Bitcoin block chain, only they have a lower difficulty target. Whenever a peer announces a new share found (new block in the P2Pool block chain), it is received by the other peers, and the other peers verify that this block contains payouts for all the previous miners who found a share (and announced it) that made it into the P2Pool share chain. This continues until some peer finds a block that has a difficulty that meets the Bitcoin network's difficulty target. This peer announces this block to the Bitcoin network and miners who have submitted shares for this block are paid in the generation transaction, proportionally to how many shares they have found in the last while. - Unknown author [3]\n\n\nDecentralized payout pooling solves the problem of centralized mining pools degrading the decentralization of Bitcoin and avoids the risk of hard to detect theft by pool operators.\n\n\nMiners are configured to connect to a P2Pool node that can be run locally, alongside the miner. P2Pool users must run a full Bitcoin node which serves the purpose of independently validating transactions and the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\n\nP2Pool nodes work on a chain of shares similar to Bitcoin's blockchain. Each node works on a block that includes payouts to the previous shares' owners and the node itself, which can also result in a share if it meets P2Pool's difficulty. \n\n\n\n\n# Install \np2pool-vtc\n dependencies and \npython-pip\n   \n\n\npi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo apt-get install python-rrdtool python-pygame python-scipy python-twisted python-twisted-web python-imaging python-pip -y\n  \n\n\n# Install \nbitcoin\n dependencies and \nlibffi-dev\n \n\n\npi@raspberrypi:~/p2pool-vtc $ sudo apt-get install build-essential libtool autotools-dev automake pkg-config libffi-dev libssl-dev libevent-dev bsdmainutils python3 -y\n\n\n# Clone \np2pool-vtc\n\n\npi@raspberrypi:~ $ git clone https://github.com/vertcoin-project/p2pool-vtc.git\nCloning into 'p2pool-vtc'...\nremote: Counting objects: 8393, done.\nremote: Total 8393 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 8393\nReceiving objects: 100% (8393/8393), 2.54 MiB | 0 bytes/s, done.\nResolving deltas: 100% (5611/5611), done.\n\n\n\n# Change directory to \np2pool-vtc\n\n\npi@raspberrypi:~ $ cd p2pool-vtc/\n  \n\n\n# Install \nrequirements.txt\n dependencies\n\n\npi@raspberrypi:~/p2pool-vtc $ pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n\n# Configure P2Pool\n\n\npi@raspberrypi:~/p2pool-vtc $ cd lyra2re-hash-python/\n\n\npi@raspberrypi:~/p2pool-vtc/lyra2re-hash-python $ git submodule init\n\n\npi@raspberrypi:~/p2pool-vtc/lyra2re-hash-python $ git submodule update\n\n\npi@raspberrypi:~/p2pool-vtc/lyra2re-hash-python $ sudo python setup.py install\n  \n\n\n# Download alternate  web frontend for P2Pool\n\n\npi@raspberrypi:~/p2pool-vtc/lyra2re-hash-python $ cd\n\n\npi@raspberrypi:~ $ git clone https://github.com/hardcpp/P2PoolExtendedFrontEnd.git\n\n\npi@raspberrypi:~ $ cd P2PoolExtendedFrontEnd\n  \n\n\n# Move all files in \nP2PoolExtendedFrontEnd\n to the \nweb-static\n folder in \np2pool-vtc\n\n\npi@raspberrypi:~/P2PoolExtendedFrontEnd $ mv * /home/pi/p2pool-vtc/web-static/\n\n\npi@raspberrypi:~/P2PoolExtendedFrontEnd $ cd\n  \n\n\n# Clean up\n\n\npi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo rm -r P2PoolExtendedFrontEnd/\n\n\nNetwork 1 - Firewall Configuration\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nIf you are a smaller miner with 2 graphics cards or less or are using your CPU, it is recommended to use Network 2.

In order to run efficiently and effectively, it needs peers run by different people... and the more the better. [1]  This tutorial will describe how to create a Vertcoin \u201cfull node\u201d (a Vertcoin server that contains the full blockchain and propagates transactions throughout the Vertcoin network via peers). This system will not mine for Vertcoins... it will play its part to keep the Vertcoin peer-to-peer network healthy and strong. For a detailed explanation for why it is important to have a healthy Vertcoin peer-to-peer network, read this  article  about Bitcoin full nodes. [2]  Also please note this will be a \u201cheadless\u201d server... meaning we will not be using a GUI to configure Vertcoin or check to see how things are running. In fact, once the server is set up, you will only interact with it using command line calls over SSH. The idea is to have this full node be simple, low-power, and something that \u201cjust runs\u201d in your basement, closet, etc.",

            "text": "If you are serious about mining  Vertcoin  please check out the  One Click Miner: https://github.com/vertcoin-project/One-Click-Miner .  OCM  gives the best mining experience with the least technical setup.   This section gives you the techncial know how of setting up an instance of a Vertcoin P2Pool on the Raspberry Pi to run alongside the  vertcoind  daemon. I  DO NOT RECOMMEND  anyone who is serious about mining  Vertcoin  to mine on a  p2pool  setup on the Raspberry Pi  Vertcoin  full node. I have experienced connectivity issues between  p2pool  and the  vertcoin daemon  losing connection to the full node for minutes at a time creating numerous  stratum  timeouts. This section exists only for those wishing to experiment.    P2Pool is a decentralized Bitcoin mining pool that works by creating a peer-to-peer network of miner nodes.  P2Pool creates a new block chain in which the difficulty is adjusted so a new block is found every 30 seconds. The blocks that get into the P2Pool block chain (called the \"share chain\") are the same blocks that would get into the Bitcoin block chain, only they have a lower difficulty target. Whenever a peer announces a new share found (new block in the P2Pool block chain), it is received by the other peers, and the other peers verify that this block contains payouts for all the previous miners who found a share (and announced it) that made it into the P2Pool share chain. This continues until some peer finds a block that has a difficulty that meets the Bitcoin network's difficulty target. This peer announces this block to the Bitcoin network and miners who have submitted shares for this block are paid in the generation transaction, proportionally to how many shares they have found in the last while. - Unknown author [3]  Decentralized payout pooling solves the problem of centralized mining pools degrading the decentralization of Bitcoin and avoids the risk of hard to detect theft by pool operators.  Miners are configured to connect to a P2Pool node that can be run locally, alongside the miner. P2Pool users must run a full Bitcoin node which serves the purpose of independently validating transactions and the Bitcoin blockchain.  P2Pool nodes work on a chain of shares similar to Bitcoin's blockchain. Each node works on a block that includes payouts to the previous shares' owners and the node itself, which can also result in a share if it meets P2Pool's difficulty.    # Install  p2pool-vtc  dependencies and  python-pip      pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo apt-get install python-rrdtool python-pygame python-scipy python-twisted python-twisted-web python-imaging python-pip -y     # Install  bitcoin  dependencies and  libffi-dev    pi@raspberrypi:~/p2pool-vtc $ sudo apt-get install build-essential libtool autotools-dev automake pkg-config libffi-dev libssl-dev libevent-dev bsdmainutils python3 -y  # Clone  p2pool-vtc  pi@raspberrypi:~ $ git clone https://github.com/vertcoin-project/p2pool-vtc.git\nCloning into 'p2pool-vtc'...\nremote: Counting objects: 8393, done.\nremote: Total 8393 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 8393\nReceiving objects: 100% (8393/8393), 2.54 MiB | 0 bytes/s, done.\nResolving deltas: 100% (5611/5611), done.  # Change directory to  p2pool-vtc  pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cd p2pool-vtc/     # Install  requirements.txt  dependencies  pi@raspberrypi:~/p2pool-vtc $ pip install -r requirements.txt  # Configure P2Pool  pi@raspberrypi:~/p2pool-vtc $ cd lyra2re-hash-python/  pi@raspberrypi:~/p2pool-vtc/lyra2re-hash-python $ git submodule init  pi@raspberrypi:~/p2pool-vtc/lyra2re-hash-python $ git submodule update  pi@raspberrypi:~/p2pool-vtc/lyra2re-hash-python $ sudo python setup.py install     # Download alternate  web frontend for P2Pool  pi@raspberrypi:~/p2pool-vtc/lyra2re-hash-python $ cd  pi@raspberrypi:~ $ git clone https://github.com/hardcpp/P2PoolExtendedFrontEnd.git  pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cd P2PoolExtendedFrontEnd     # Move all files in  P2PoolExtendedFrontEnd  to the  web-static  folder in  p2pool-vtc  pi@raspberrypi:~/P2PoolExtendedFrontEnd $ mv * /home/pi/p2pool-vtc/web-static/  pi@raspberrypi:~/P2PoolExtendedFrontEnd $ cd     # Clean up  pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo rm -r P2PoolExtendedFrontEnd/",

Coinbase will send a verification text to your phone number. Input the verification code to continue to the next step.\n\n\nOnce your phone number is verified you will be prompted to add a payment method to buy Bitcoin with fiat. From this screen you can choose whether you want to add a credit card or bank account for buying Bitcoin.\n\n\nIf you choose bank account you will be prompted to sign in with your bank provider to link your bank account with Coinbase. If your bank provider is not listed you will need to add your bank checking information (routing number, account number) and  your name. Coinbase will send 2 small amounts of money to your bank account and you will need to identify what the two small amounts were to confirm this bank account.\n\n\nIf you choose credit card you need to input your credit card details (credit card number, cvc, expiration date), your full name and zip code. Please note that Coinbase only accepts Visa and Mastercard credit cards.\n\n\nBuying Bitcoin\n\u00b6\n\n\nOnce you have finished the signup process on Coinbase you will be greeted by the Coinbase dashboard where you can buy and sell Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum. To buy Bitcoin click on the \"Buy and Sell\" tab located in the top left.\n\n\nIn the \"Buy and Sell\" page you can see a box on the left where you can see buy and sell options. Make sure you are on the Buy tab. From the Buy tab you can select: which currency you want to buy, you should buy Bitcoin, what payment method you want to use, how much Bitcoin you want to buy, and whether you want to repeat the current buy. Fill out all of the options and once you are done click \"Buy Bitcoin\" at the bottom of the screen. If you used a non U.S bank account to buy Bitcoin it will take a few business days to transfer the money from the bank account to Coinbase but if you used a credit card you will buy the Bitcoin instantly. If you have an U.S bank account you can buy Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum instantly\n\n\nBittrex\n\u00b6\n\n\nBittrex is one of the highest volume trading sites for crypto currencies, we will be using Bittrex to convert the Bitcoin we bought with Coinbase to Vertcoin.\n\n\nSignup\n\u00b6\n\n\nTo signup go to the \nBittrex signup page\n and signup with your email. Bittrex will send a confirmation email before you can login.\n\n\nCreate a Bitcoin Address\n\u00b6\n\n\nOnce you have confirmed your Bittrex account and have logged in, you will generate a Bitcoin address to recieve the Bitcoin that you bought from Coinbase. To generate a Bitcoin address on Bittrex go to the \nBittrex wallets page\n by clicking the \"\u0e3f Wallets\" button located in the top right of the \nBittrex home page\n.\n\n\nOn the Bittrex wallets page there is a box under \"Account Balances\" that lists all the currencies that Bittrex supports. At the top of that list there will be Bitcoin with a + and - sign to the left of it. Click the + sign and there will be a pop up where you can generate a new address from. To generate a new address just click the \"New Address\" button. Now there will be a Bitcoin address on the previous popup.\n\n\nConvert Your Bitcoin to Vertcoin\n\u00b6\n\n\nNow that you have made a Bitcoin address on Bittrex and you have bought Bitcoin with Coinbase you need to send your Bitcoin to Bittrex and Convert the Bitcoin to Vertcoin.\n\n\nSend Bitcoin From Coinbase to Bittrex\n\u00b6\n\n\nGo to \nCoinbase\n again and log in. From the main dashboard you will see the \"Accounts\" button on the top left. Click the \"Accounts\" button and you will see a few different wallets on the left. Click the send button under \"BTC Wallet\" and there will be a popup that asks for the BTC address you are sending to, where you want to withdraw the BTC from and how much BTC you want to send. In the BTC address field you need to input the BTC wallet address you generated in the \"Create a Bitcoin Address\" section earlier in this guide. Once you are done inputting the necessary information hit continue to complete the withdraw.\n\n\nConvert Your Bitcoin to Vertcoin in Bittrex\n\u00b6\n\n\nOnce you have sent your Bitcoin from Coinbase to Bittrex you will be able to see the Bitcoin under \"Account Balances\" in the \"\u0e3f Wallets\" page. If the Bitcoin you sent is under the \"Pending Deposit\" column that means your transaction is still confirming on the Bitcoin blockchain, to check the status of the transaction scroll down until you see \"Pending Deposits\" where you can view the status of your deposit.\n\n\nOnce your transaction is confirmed you can buy Vertcoin by going to the \nBittrex VTC -> BTC markets page\n and you will see a lot of market information pop up. Under the value graph you will see the \"Trading\" section where you can buy and sell Vertcoin. To buy Vertcoin use the \"Buy Vertcoin\" section to buy Vertcoin. From the \"Buy Vertcoin\" section you need to input how much Vertcoin you want to buy, what price you want to buy it at (price in Bitcoin) and what type of order you want to place. Once you have inputted all the necessary information click \"Buy Vertcoin\" and confirm the buy order.  \n\n\nSend Your Vertcoin From Bittrex to Your Vertcoin Core Wallet\n\u00b6\n\n\nOnce your buy order has filled, it is crucial to transfer your Vertcoin from Bittrex to your local wallet. When your coins are on an exchange you don't actually own your own coins and private keys, if the exchange were to lose your coins you would not be able to get them back. If you have not already set up your Vertcoin Core wallet, do so by going to the \nCore wallet page\n located in the wallets section.\n\n\nGet your Vertcoin Address from Vertcoin Core\n\u00b6\n\n\nTo get your Vertcoin address from Vertcoin Core, open Vertcoin Core and go to \nFile -> Recieving Addresses\n and you will see all of your Vertcoin addresses, select one and hit copy to copy the address to your clipboard.\n\n\nWithdraw Vertcoin from Bittrex\n\u00b6\n\n\nTo withdraw your Vertcoin from Bittrex to your Core wallet go to the \nBittrex wallets page\n and click the - sign next to Vertcoin in the \"Account Balances\" section. There will be a popup where you will input the details of your withdraw such as: the address you got from Vertcoin Core and how much Vertcoin you want to withdraw. Once you are done inputting all the required information click withdraw and confirm the withdraw.\n\n\nNow that you have withdrawn your Vertcoin from Bittrex you will see the coins show up in your wallet after a few minutes.\n\n\nLiteBit\n\u00b6\n\n\nIf you don't want to use Coinbase and Bittrex, you can also use \nLiteBit\n. Here it is possible to buy and sell Vertcoin (and other coins) without converting to Bitcoin first. There is a catch however: LiteBit uses a \"spread\" between buying and selling prices of about 5%. Therefore, buying Vertcoin will be about 5% more expensive and selling will also be about 5% under the actual value.\n\n\nCreating an account\n\u00b6\n\n\nCreating an account requires basic details like your name and e-mail address. Then there are tier 1, 2 and 3 validations to ensure you are a real person. This varies from bank account validation to copying a bill or bank note for address validation. The validation you have completed, influences the maximum trading amount. The process is relatively straightforward and can be done in a couple of minutes.\n\n\nWallets\n\u00b6\n\n\nYou can store your Vertcoins in two ways: in your own wallet and in the online wallet provided by LiteBit. Trading is a lot easier when using the wallet provided, but do keep in mind that having your Vertcoins in their wallet might be a security risk. They would not be the first exchange to fall prey to hackers, so bear that in mind when making your decision.",
