### What is a wallet?
 
Similar to a traditional wallet you may carry in your pocket, a vertcoin wallet is used to store money. The difference is that instead of storing a collection of bills and cards, a vertcoin wallet stores a collection of vertcoin private keys. Typically a wallet is encrypted with a password or otherwise protected from unauthorized access.

Unlike the Vertcoin network, a Vertcoin wallet is controlled only by its owner. It's important to keep your vertcoin wallet safe by either setting a strong password or otherwise keeping it out of reach of malicious individuals.
 
### Types of Wallets

There are different wallets to choose from, each providing different features. All vertcoin wallets must conform to the established Vertcoin protocol so they can all be used to send and receive funds regardless of their specific implementation. This is similar to email where you have many choices of email providers but they all "speak the same language" and are able to send messages to each other.

There are several categories of Vertcoin wallets:
 
#### Desktop Wallets

You can install the wallet software directly on your computer. This allows an individual to have full control (and responsibility) over their wallet.

In a desktop wallet, the private keys are stored on a hard drive so it's only possible to access the funds using the computer the wallet is installed on. If the wallet file were to become corrupted with no backup available, the vertcoins stored in that wallet would be lost forever. For this reason it's extremely important that strong passwords are used and reliable backups are made of any desktop wallet. It's equally important that the wallet and any backups are kept safely out of reach of malicious individuals.

Desktop wallets fall into two main categories known as "full nodes" or "light" clients. Full nodes host a full copy of the blockchain (about 4 GB as of May 2018) while light clients provide only vertcoin storage capabilities while depending on an external source to read the blockchain. More examples of wallets can be found [here](https://vertcoin.org/download/).
 
#### Mobile Wallets

Mobile wallets are simply vertcoin wallets designed for a mobile device. This means they can easily scan QR codes, are easy to navigate with a touch screen, and are accessible while on the move. The Coinomi mobile wallet for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/coinomi-wallet/id1333588809) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coinomi.wallet) allows you access to send and receive Vertcoin.

Mobile wallets are almost always "light" clients in that they do not store a full copy of the blockchain.
 
#### Hardware Wallet

A hardware wallet is a specialized type of device designed specifically to store cryptocurrency. The advantage is that hardware wallets are much more difficult for a malicious user to compromise when compared to a desktop or mobile wallet since they use the bare minimum amount of software required to safely store vertcoins. 
 
#### Paper Wallets

Paper wallets are a way to embody vertcoins in a physical medium such as paper or metal. If a paper wallet is lost or destroyed, the vertcoin stored on it are gone forever.
