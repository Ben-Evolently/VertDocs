# Vertcoin Hardware Wallets

If you are looking to store large amounts of Vertcoin offline, a Hardware Wallet is a better option than a [Paper Wallet](./Paper-Wallets/). With a Hardware Wallet, your private key is never on a computer, and thus never in danger of being stolen by malware or other malicious programs.

## Ledger

At the moment, the only Hardware Wallet that supports Vertcoin is [Ledger](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/). Ledger has detailed instructions to set it up properly, and the wallet interface is in a simple Chrome app. Similarly to the other wallets, Ledger will have you write down a 24 word seed phrase that you must keep in a safe place in the event that you lose the device.

!!!warning "Seed Phrase"
    If you get a Ledger device, make sure it is from a trusted retailer. There have been instances of people purchasing devices with pre-generated seed phrases and had their funds stolen. If you believe your device may had been tampered with, or if it comes with pre-generated seed words, **reset the device in order to generate a new private key and seed phrase before sending any funds.**

## Trezor

[Trezor](https://trezor.io/) is another Hardware wallet popular in the Bitcoin community, but it does not yet support Vertcoin.
