# Vertcoin Hardware Wallets

If you are looking to store large amounts of Vertcoin offline, a Hardware Wallet is a better option than a [Paper Wallet](./Paper-Wallets/).

## Ledger

At the moment, the only Hardware Wallet that supports Vertcoin is [Ledger](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/). With a Hardware Wallet, your private key is never on a computer, and thus never in danger of being stolen by malware or other malicious programs.

Ledger has detailed instructions to set it up properly, and the wallet interface is in a simple Chrome app. Similarly to the other wallets, Ledger will have you write down a 24 word recovery phrase that you must keep in a safe place in the event that you lose the device.

    If you get a Ledger device, make sure it is from a trusted retailer. There have been instances of people purchasing devices that had been tampered with and had their funds stolen. If you believe your device may had been tampered with, reset the device in order to generate a new private key.

## Trezor

[Trezor](https://trezor.io/) is another Hardware wallet popular in the Bitcoin community, but it does not yet support Vertcoin.
