# Buying Vertcoin

## Signup and Use Required Sites

### Coinbase
Coinbase is the largest site for buying Bitcoin with fiat (your local currency), and we will be using it for buying Bitcoin.

#### Signup
To signup for a Coinbase account go to [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com) and click signup in the top right corner.


You will be prompted to enter details such as: your name, your email, your location, etc. When inputting your personal information make sure to make it match the information on your bank account, PayPal, and credit card to prevent issues when adding a payment method.


After inputting your personal information you will be prompted to input a phone number. Coinbase will send a verification text to your phone number. Input the verification code to continue to the next step.


Once your phone number is verified you will be prompted to add a payment method to buy Bitcoin with fiat. From this screen you can choose whether you want to add a credit card or bank account for buying Bitcoin.


If you choose bank account you will be prompted to sign in with your bank provider to link your bank account with Coinbase. If your bank provider is not listed you will need to add your bank checking information (routing number, account number) and  your name. Coinbase will send 2 small amounts of money to your bank account and you will need to identify what the two small amounts were to confirm this bank account.


If you choose credit card you need to input your credit card details (credit card number, cvc, expiration date), your full name and zip code. Please note that Coinbase only accepts Visa and Mastercard credit cards.


#### Buying Bitcoin
Once you have finished the signup process on Coinbase you will be greeted by the Coinbase dashboard where you can buy and sell Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum. To buy Bitcoin click on the "Buy and Sell" tab located in the top left.


In the "Buy and Sell" page you can see a box on the left where you can see buy and sell options. Make sure you are on the Buy tab. From the Buy tab you can select: which currency you want to buy, you should buy Bitcoin, what payment method you want to use, how much Bitcoin you want to buy, and whether you want to repeat the current buy. Fill out all of the options and once you are done click "Buy Bitcoin" at the bottom of the screen. If you used a bank account to buy Bitcoin it will take a few business days to transfer the money from the bank account to Coinbase but if you used a credit card you will buy the Bitcoin instantly.


### Bittrex
Bittrex is one of the highest volume trading sites for crypto currencies, we will be using Bittrex to convert the Bitcoin we bought with Coinbase to Vertcoin.


#### Signup
To signup go to the [Bittrex signup page](https://bittrex.com/account/Register) and signup with your email. Bittrex will send a confirmation email before you can login.


#### Create a Bitcoin Address
Once you have confirmed your Bittrex account and have logged in, you will generate a Bitcoin address to recieve the Bitcoin that you bought from Coinbase. To generate a Bitcoin address on Bittrex go to the [Bittrex wallets page](bittrex.com/Balance) by clicking the "à¸¿ Wallets" button located in the top right of the [Bittrex home page](https://bittrex.com/Home/Markets).


On the Bittrex wallets page there is a box under "Account Balances" that lists all the currencies that Bittrex supports. At the top of that list there will be Bitcoin with a + and - sign to the left of it. Click the + sign and there will be a pop up where you can generate a new address from. To generate a new address just click the "New Address" button. Now there will be a Bitcoin address on the previous popup.
