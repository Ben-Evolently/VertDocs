# Open Bounties

Bounties are only paid upon completion to standards at the discretion of the 
development team. Please contact the development team on 
[Discord](https://discord.gg/SUy9Hsr) prior to starting work. If there are 
multiple bidders, it is possible to collaborate and split the bounty.

VertDocs bounties can be claimed by opening a new pull request on the 
[VertDocs Github page](https://github.com/Bryangoodson/VertDocs) with at least
one change in it, declaring the section you are working on. From that point you
will have seven days to provide a final draft for the section before the pull
request will be closed, and the section will be opened for other submissions.





### VertDocs

#### Value:  0.01 VTC per word
#### Description

In order to populate [VertDocs](https://docs.vertcoin.org) with informational 
content for users, we will be assigning various unwritten sections with bounties
for completion. The bounty available and description of the desired content will
be written under each heading with unwritten content. 

If you plan to work on a page, please create an issue on the Github page and add a `work in progress" label. Pages in progress with no commits for 1 week will be removed.
